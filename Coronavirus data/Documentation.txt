This Python package is used  to get information regarding the novel corona virus provided by Johns Hopkins university and worldometers.info. 

For understanding this project you need to have the basic understanding of python, lists, dictionaries and some object-oriented programming.

By default it uses the data from John Hopkins University, you can change the source to worldometer (I have shown how to change in the source code).

Data returned in basically a python format of combination of lists and dictionaries. You can access the data by using normal python instruction since data returned is in dictionary inside a list.

Using this package you can regularly access the countries which are affected by corona virus, active cases, deaths, confirmed cases, recovered cases etc.
