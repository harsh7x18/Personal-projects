It is a simple project based on geocoding. 

Geocoding is the process of converting addresses (like a street address) into geographic coordinates (like latitude and longitude), which you can use to place markers on a map, or position
the map. 

To completely understand this project you got to have basic knowledge about python, json, REST API and file handling. 

While running the code, first it asks for a address. After you enter the address it returns data in json which you can access and print a particular piece of information if you want to.
Returned data include latitute, longitude, place id, long name, short name, formatted address.
